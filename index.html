                "The Premier League is the world's leading league, with exciting
                competitive football on the pitch and
                passionate fans supporting in stadiums throughout the country
                every week throughout the season."
                The 2018/19 Premier League season was competitive to the last,
                with fans across the world captivated by a
                brilliant title race.The football played by Manchester City and
                Liverpool was of the highest quality and a
                joy to watch.
                City edged it and deserve huge credit for their success - they
                are the first club to retain the Premier
                League title for a decade.As the final stages of the campaign
                played out, I was struck by the performances
                of the clubs standing in
                the way of the top two.Leicester City matched Manchester City
                before Vincent Kompany settled things with an
                extraordinary goal, and
                Liverpool were pushed all the way by Newcastle United before a
                late winner from Divock Origi.
                Wolves surprised everyone with a seventh-place finish. With 57
                points, it was the best campaign by a newly
                promoted club since 2001.

                In the early 1990s, English First Division clubs believed that a
                radical restructuring of football was
                needed if they and the game in general were to develop and
                flourish.
                So on 17 July 1991, they signed the Founder Members Agreement,
                establishing the basic principles for the
                setting up of the Premier League.The League would have
                commercial independence from the Football League and
                The FA, leaving it free to
                organise its own broadcast and sponsorship agreement.On 20
                February 1992, the 22 First Division clubs
                resigned from the Football League en masse and three months
                later, on 27 May, the Premier League was established as a
                limited company.The first television deal was
                struck with pay-TV broadcaster BSkyB, a radical move at the
                time, but Sky has
                been ever-present and has played a key role in developing the
                League to its present levels.
                The inaugural Premier League campaign started on Saturday 15
                August, 1992, with 22 clubs.
                The 22 inaugural members of the new Premier League were Arsenal,
                Aston Villa, Blackburn Rovers, Chelsea,
                Coventry City, Crystal Palace, Everton, Ipswich Town, Leeds
                United, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester
                United, Middlesbrough, Norwich City, Nottingham Forest, Oldham
                Athletic, Queens Park Rangers, Sheffield
                United, Sheffield Wednesday, Southampton, Tottenham Hotspur, and
                Wimbledon.
                Of these, six clubs have been ever-present in the Premier
                League: Arsenal, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool,
                Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur.
                When the Premier League was formed, there was always the
                intention to reduce the number of clubs to 20 to
                promote development and excellence at club and international
                level. This was achieved at the end of the
                1994/95 season when four clubs were relegated and just two
                promoted.
